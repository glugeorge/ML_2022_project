# Using Machine Learning Techniques to Emulate Ice Sheet Velocities from a Parallel, High Resolution Ice Sheet Model
This is the repository that contains scripts for my project for Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Engineering.

The notebook names are relatively self explanatory and the notebooks themselves include descriptions for what they do. For a recommended order, I started with the exploratory look at data, then pre-processed it. Afterwards, I dove into Part I and then Part II of the project.
